# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  genders = Gender.create([{ id: 1 , name: "Male" }, { id: 2 , name: "Female" }])
